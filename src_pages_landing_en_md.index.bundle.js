 * ATTENTION: The "eval" devtool has been used (maybe by default in mode: "development").
 * This devtool is neither made for production nor for readable output files.
 * It uses "eval()" calls to create a separate source file in the browser devtools.
 * If you are trying to read the output file, select a different devtool (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
 * or disable the default devtool with "devtool: false".
 * If you are looking for production-ready output files, see mode: "production" (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).

The students build their own air:bit sensor from its individual components consisting of\\na GPS module, a dust particle sensor, a temperature and humidity sensor and a memory card reader to store the collected measurements.\\n\\nAs this project targets Norwegian Upper Secondary School students, the resources, videos and teaching materials found on this site are primarily in Norwegian language. We will be working with translating the material to English.  \\nIn the meantime you can use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fairbit.uit.no%2Fpublic%2Fwiki%2FHome.html) to read through our teaching material. We realize that using Google Translate is not ideal, but it will allow non-Norwegian readers to get more information about our project while we work on translating everything properly.\\n\\nWe integrate air quality data from the official data feeds provided by [NILU &ndash; Norwegian Institute for Air Research](https://www.nilu.no/). As well as weather records from [The Norwegian Meteorological Institute](https://met.no/en).\\n\\nPlease contact us for more information or visit the project site on [Github](https://github.com/fjukstad/luft).\");\n\n//# sourceURL=webpack://airbit/./src/pages/landing_en.md?");
